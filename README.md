# CS 203 Fall 2024 Lab 13

### Hello all!

#### Welcome to the final lab assignment of the semester.

####    This lab will incorporate file IO, encryption, decryption, and using GitHub!

Included in `src` is two files `encrypted.txt` && `encryptMe.txt` the goal 
is to decrypt the former and encrypt the latter text file 
and push your code/files  to canvas. 

The file is encrypted with a **caesar cipher**, please Google what 
this is if you do not understand how it is working.
`encrypted.txt` **is shifted >1 && <10 times. Encrypt** `encryptMe.txt`
**With the same amount of shift**

There is already a scaffold to help you start coding, but please feel free
to add any helper functions you would like!

## Here are some steps to get you started
### Prerequisites
1. A GitHub account, make one [here](https://github.com)
2. Git installed on your machine, install it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
You can test to see if you have git on your machine by opening a new terminal/cmd instance and typing 
```bash
git
```
If you have git, you should get a help menu

## Clone this repository

Clone this repository by typing "git clone https://github.com/SamMPhillips/Fa24_CS203_Lab13" in your terminal, after cd'ing into the desired directory. 
<br>
<br>
<br>



## Create a New Private Repository 
Create a private repository on your GitHub account named "Fa24_CS203_Lab13". Look at the lab slides for more details! 

###Once your repository is created, make sure to add all 3 TA's as collaborators: SamMPhillips, Abbie-m, MichaelGathara. 

<br><br><br>

## Push To Your Private Repository
Now that you have cloned this repository onto your local machine and created a new private repository, it's time to push to your repository. You will do this from your computer's terminal. The lab slides include step-by-step instructions for this. 

<br><br><br>

## Next

- Read `encrypted.txt`
- Decrypt the file
- Write to a new file, _it must be named_ `decrypted.txt`


- Read `encryptMe.txt`
- Encrypt it with the same amount of shift as `encrypted.txt`
- Write to a new file, _it must be named_ `newEncrypted.txt`

<br><br><br>

## Commit and push the code to your repository


## Upload a link to your repository to canvas!

### Good luck!

## Tips:
- You made want to comment out the method calls to encrypt and decrypt as you fill out those functions
- Decrypting is the same an encrypting, but backwards
- You will need to do some type casting
- Ceaser's cipher should only apply to letters, uppercase and lowercase. Not special characters or spaces
- Remember that the ONLY approved sources are your lecture and lab notes, Zybooks, and the official Java documentation. If you use official documentation, include a link to the exact page where you found the syntax in a comment.
